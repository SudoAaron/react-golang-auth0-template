# React-Golang Auth0 Integration Template

## Introduction
Welcome to the react-golang-auth0-template â€“ a full-stack application template demonstrating a React frontend and a Golang backend integrated with Auth0 for authentication and authorization. This template is ideal for developers looking to implement secure full-stack applications with modern technologies.

## Project Structure
This project consists of two main components:

1. React Frontend: A React-based web application for user interaction and frontend logic.
2. Golang Backend: A Golang API providing secure backend services.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, you'll need to set up both the frontend and backend components. Here are the general steps you'll follow:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js (for React) and Go (for Golang) installed on your machine.
Set up an Auth0 account for handling authentication.

### Setup and Run React Frontend
1. Navigate to the react directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the React README to set up and start the React application.
3. The React application will run on http://localhost:3000.

### Setup and Run Golang Backend
1. Navigate to the golang directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the Golang README to set up and start the Golang API.
3. The Golang API will run on http://localhost:3001.

## Testing the Integration
Once both applications are running:

1. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
2. Test the Auth0 integration by attempting to log in through the React application.
3. Ensure that the React app can communicate with the Golang API securely using Auth0 tokens.
